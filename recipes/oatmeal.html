    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>oats</li>
        <Li>milk</Li>
    <li>brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Start by measuring the oats and liquids. The ratio is 1:2. The usual serving size is ½ cup oats to 1 cup of water, milk or combination of both. I like combining ½ a cup of water and ½ a cup of milk for the best consistency.

        Then place in the microwave without a cover on it (we dont want any microwave accidents when the liquid boils). Microwave on high for 2 minutes and the consistency should be perfect.
